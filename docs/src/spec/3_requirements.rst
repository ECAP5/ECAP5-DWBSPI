    - The select output array indicates where valid data is expected on the wb_dat_i signal array during READ cycles, and where it is placed on the wb_dat_o signal array during WRITE cycles. Each individual select signal correlates to one of four active bytes on the 32-bit data port.

    - 1
    - The strobe output indicates a valid data transfer cycle. It is used to qualify various other signals on the interface.

    - The acknowledge input, when asserted, indicates the normal termination of a bus cycle.
  * - wb_cyc_i

    - The cycle output, when asserted, indicates that a valid bus cycle is in progress. This signal is asserted for the duration of all bus cycles.

    - 1
    - The stall input indicates that current slave is not able to accept the transfer in the transaction queue.

Functional Requirements

Memory interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wishbone protocol
`````````````````

The following requirements are extracted from the Wishbone specification.

.. requirement:: F_WISHBONE_DATASHEET_01
  :derivedfrom: U_MEMORY_INTERFACE_01

  The memory interface shall comply with the Wishbone Datasheet provided in section 2.1.

.. requirement:: F_WISHBONE_RESET_01
  :derivedfrom: U_MEMORY_INTERFACE_01

  The memory interface shall initialize itself at the rising edge of clk_i following the assertion of rst_i.

.. requirement:: F_WISHBONE_RESET_02
  :derivedfrom: U_MEMORY_INTERFACE_01

  The memory interface shall stay in the initialization state until the rising edge of clk_i following the deassertion of rst_i.

.. requirement:: F_WISHBONE_TRANSFER_CYCLE_01
  :derivedfrom: U_MEMORY_INTERFACE_01

  The memory interface shall only respond to transfer cycles when wb_cyc_i is asserted.

.. requirement:: F_WISHBONE_HANDSHAKE_01
  :derivedfrom: U_MEMORY_INTERFACE_01

  The memory interface shall assert the wb_ack_o signal in response to the logical AND of wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i.

.. requirement:: F_WISHBONE_READ_CYCLE_01
  :derivedfrom: U_MEMORY_INTERFACE_01

  The memory interface shall conform to the READ cycle detailed in the figure below.

.. figure:: ../assets/wishbone-read.svg
   :align: center
   
   Timing diagram of the wishbone read cycle

.. requirement:: F_WISHBONE_WRITE_CYCLE_01
  :derivedfrom: U_MEMORY_INTERFACE_01

  The memory interface shall conform to the WRITE cycle detailed in figure below.

.. figure:: ../assets/wishbone-write.svg
   :align: center
   
   Timing diagram of the wishbone write cycle

.. requirement:: F_WISHBONE_TIMING_01
  :rationale: As long as the memory interface is designed within the clock domain of clk_i, the requirement will be satisfied by using the place and route tool.
  :derivedfrom: U_MEMORY_INTERFACE_01

  The clock input clk_i shall coordinate all activites for the internal logic within the memory interface. All output signals of the memory interface shall be registered at the rising edge of clk_i. All input signals of the memory interface shall be stable before the rising edge of clk_i.

Memory-mapped registers
```````````````````````

.. requirement:: F_REGISTERS_01
   :derivedfrom: U_REGISTERS_01, U_MEMORY_INTERFACE_01, U_BAUD_RATE_01, U_PARITY_BIT_01, U_DATA_SIZE_01, U_STOP_BIT_01

   The following registers shall be implemented and accessible through the wishbone memory interface.
